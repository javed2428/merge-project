So while you can do even more, you won't feel like you're holding any more.\niPad mini was designed to be a concentration, rather than a reduction, of iPad. It's small. But when you use it, it doesn't feel small. In addition to the Retina display, we packed in a tremendous amount of power and capability. And yet iPad mini remains the perfect mini size. That's because we engineered its components to be as thin and light as possible. It feels like an iPad in every way - only it's mini.\niPad mini is amazing to hold. And behold. Every photo is incredibly detailed and vibrant, and every line of text is remarkably crisp and clear. With higher resolution than an HDTV, the gorgeous Retina display is a feast for the eyes.\no make the Retina display in iPad mini incredibly sharp and vivid, we had to \ufb01nd a way to pack every one of the 3.1 million pixels from the 9.7-inch iPad into a 7.9-inch display. Every pixel in a display has multiple signals telling it when to light up. And with a 2048-by-1536-resolution display, more pixels and more signals are placed closer together on the same plane, so signals can get crossed and image quality can su\ufb00er. To make sure everything on iPad mini looks crystal clear, Apple engineers elevated the pixels onto a di\ufb00erent plane - separating them from the signals. In the end, the pixel density jumped to 326 pixels per inch - so dense the human eye can't distinguish individual pixels - making everything look incredibly detailed, vibrant, and razor sharp.\nYour fingerprint is the perfect password. You always have it with you. And no one can ever guess what it is.
