And it weighs less than a pound. So it's even easier to hold in one hand and take with you anywhere.\nWhen it was introduced four years ago, the original iPad set the standard for thinness and lightness. Since then, iPad has become even thinner and lighter. But thanks to its durable aluminum unibody, iPad Air 2 doesn't sacri\ufb01ce strength in the pursuit of thinness. From the moment you pick it up, you feel how sturdy and rigid it is.\nThe displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal re\ufb02ectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid.\nThe LCD layer is now closer to your eyes (and your \ufb01ngers), so when you touch the screen it feels as if you're touching your content. And we've improved the sensitivity of the screen, so it tracks your finger even more accurately, especially when you make quick gestures. Which means everything you do - playing games, sur\ufb01ng the web, enjoying photos and videos - becomes more personal, immediate, and immersive.\niPad Air 2 features a custom-designed antireflective coating that reduces glare by 56 percent, making it the least re\ufb02ective tablet in the world. In virtually any kind of environment - o\ufb03ces, classrooms, outdoors - everything is clearer and more readable.\n\n\nWe're always thinking about the impact our products have on the world. And we know that impact continues after the end of a product's useful life. That's why nearly every Apple product is made from highly recyclable materials like aluminum, and why we go to great lengths to exclude harmful toxins from our components.\n      \n      ", "title": "Apple iPad Air 2 (Space Grey, 64GB, WiFi + Cellular)", "price": ["52,690.00"], "link": "http://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPad-Space-Grey-Cellular/dp/B00OTWWP0S", "img_src": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ap2B-agbL._AA160_.jpg", "brnd": "Apple"},

And it weighs less than a pound. So it's even easier to hold in one hand and take with you anywhere. When it was introduced four years ago, the original iPad set the standard for thinness and lightness. Since then, iPad has become even thinner and lighter. But thanks to its durable aluminum unibody, iPad Air 2 doesn't sacri\ufb01ce strength in the pursuit of thinness. From the moment you pick it up, you feel how sturdy and rigid it is. The displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal re\ufb02ectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid. The LCD layer is now closer to your eyes (and your \ufb01ngers), so when you touch the screen it feels as if you're touching your content. And we've improved the sensitivity of the screen, so it tracks your finger even more accurately, especially when you make quick gestures. Which means everything you do - playing games, sur\ufb01ng the web, enjoying photos and videos - becomes more personal, immediate, and immersive. iPad Air 2 features a custom-designed antireflective coating that reduces glare by 56 percent, making it the least re\ufb02ective tablet in the world. In virtually any kind of environment - o\ufb03ces, classrooms, outdoors - everything is clearer and more readable. We're always thinking about the impact our products have on the world. And we know that impact continues after the end of a product's useful life. That's why nearly every Apple product is made from highly recyclable materials like aluminum, and why we go to great lengths to exclude harmful toxins from our components.\n      \n      ", "title": "Apple iPad Air 2 (Space Grey, 16GB, WiFi + Cellular)", "price": ["38,900.00"], "link": "http://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPad-Space-Grey-Cellular/dp/B00OTWS0L6", "img_src": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ap2B-agbL._AA160_.jpg", "brnd": "Apple"},

And it weighs less than a pound. So it's even easier to hold in one hand and take with you anywhere.\nWhen it was introduced four years ago, the original iPad set the standard for thinness and lightness. Since then, iPad has become even thinner and lighter. But thanks to its durable aluminum unibody, iPad Air 2 doesn't sacri\ufb01ce strength in the pursuit of thinness. From the moment you pick it up, you feel how sturdy and rigid it is.\nThe displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal re\ufb02ectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid.\nThe LCD layer is now closer to your eyes (and your \ufb01ngers), so when you touch the screen it feels as if you're touching your content. And we've improved the sensitivity of the screen, so it tracks your finger even more accurately, especially when you make quick gestures. Which means everything you do - playing games, sur\ufb01ng the web, enjoying photos and videos - becomes more personal, immediate, and immersive.\niPad Air 2 features a custom-designed antireflective coating that reduces glare by 56 percent, making it the least re\ufb02ective tablet in the world. In virtually any kind of environment - o\ufb03ces, classrooms, outdoors - everything is clearer and more readable.\n\n\nWe're always thinking about the impact our products have on the world. And we know that impact continues after the end of a product's useful life. That's why nearly every Apple product is made from highly recyclable materials like aluminum, and why we go to great lengths to exclude harmful toxins from our components.\n      \n      ", "title": "Apple iPad Air 2 (Space Grey, 128GB, WiFi + Cellular)", "price": ["58,895.00"], "link": "http://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPad-Space-128GB-Cellular/dp/B00OTWXW2I", "img_src": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ap2B-agbL._AA160_.jpg", "brnd": "Apple"},

It has a stunning 7.9\u2011inch Retina display, an incredibly powerful A7 chip, advanced wireless technologies, and Touch ID. Yet it's still thin and light. So while you can do even more, you won't feel like you're holding any more.\niPad mini was designed to be a concentration, rather than a reduction, of iPad. It's small. But when you use it, it doesn't feel small. In addition to the Retina display, we packed in a tremendous amount of power and capability. And yet iPad mini remains the perfect mini size. That's because we engineered its components to be as thin and light as possible. It feels like an iPad in every way - only it's mini.\niPad mini is amazing to hold. And behold. Every photo is incredibly detailed and vibrant, and every line of text is remarkably crisp and clear. With higher resolution than an HDTV, the gorgeous Retina display is a feast for the eyes.\no make the Retina display in iPad mini incredibly sharp and vivid, we had to \ufb01nd a way to pack every one of the 3.1 million pixels from the 9.7-inch iPad into a 7.9-inch display. Every pixel in a display has multiple signals telling it when to light up. And with a 2048-by-1536-resolution display, more pixels and more signals are placed closer together on the same plane, so signals can get crossed and image quality can su\ufb00er. To make sure everything on iPad mini looks crystal clear, Apple engineers elevated the pixels onto a di\ufb00erent plane - separating them from the signals. In the end, the pixel density jumped to 326 pixels per inch - so dense the human eye can't distinguish individual pixels - making everything look incredibly detailed, vibrant, and razor sharp.\nYour fingerprint is the perfect password. You always have it with you. And no one can ever guess what it is. Our breakthrough Touch ID technology uses a unique fingerprint identity sensor to make unlocking your iPad mini easy and secure.\n      \n      ", "title": "Apple iPad Mini 3 (Gold, 16GB, WiFi + Cellular)", "price": ["38,900.00"], "link": "http://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPad-Mini-Gold-Cellular/dp/B00OTXK0OU", "img_src": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51StF2QMOUL._AA160_.jpg", "brnd": "Apple"},
